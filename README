Environment Set Up

All the frameworks are cross-platform for Mac and Windows.  

1.  Java: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html.  
  (If you’re installing JDK for the first time on Windows, you might need to
  add C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65\bin to your paths manually in order to
  be able to use javac on the command line.)

2. Activator: https://www.typesafe.com/activator/download
    You can use the activator.bat or ./activator directly from the downloaded
    package.  You can also follow the steps below to add activator to your
    environment so you can launch activator easily when you’re developing the
    project.

  * For Windows
    1. Unzip the activator package to a target location e.g. C:\Users\Public\activator-dist
    2. Go to the Environment Variables dialog
    3. Under System variables, find Path and press Edit... 
    4. Add to your path: e.g. C:\Users\Public\activator-dist
    5. Open cmd.exe and enter activator help. If the command is not
    recognized, the environment variable wasn’t configured properly.

  * For Mac OS X
    1. Unzip activator-dist package somewhere
    2. Add lines to ~/.profile
    3. export ACTIVATOR_HOME="absolute path to where activator was unzipped"
    4. export PATH="$PATH:$ACTIVATOR_HOME"
    5. source ~/.profile
    6. Fix execute flag: chmod +x $ACTIVATOR_HOME/activator
    7. Test with activator help

3. Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Verifying environment setup
===========================

  To ensure proper setup, type in “activator -help” on your command line to
  test if Activator is properly installed. For node, type in “node --version”.
  Open a new command line in the project directory. To start it, simply type in
  “activator run”.

  To stop the server, simply use Ctrl + D.

  When you see that screen, open up your web browser type in
  http://localhost:9000/ in your address bar. 


This is your new Play application
=================================
This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.
