# management-clients

In this repository you will find three repos for table tennis tournament management. All clients are designed as SPAs and use angular as js framework. Also they use [ngrx](https://ngrx.io/) for client site state management.

## admin-view
The [admin-view](./admin-view/README.md) is designed to manage the tournament flow. You can assign matches to tables, call matches, enter results. Also you get the option for a queue to let the tournament flow without interaction.

## result-view

The [result-view](./result-view/README.md) is designed to show current results of the tournament.

## tablemanager-view

The [tablemanager-view](./tablemanager-view/README.md) is designed to manage special tables. You can enter a result (set and match) for a specific table. You can request a second call for player if he doesn't appear.
